        <p>What is the chain of command for making formal complaints?</p>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your answer here..."></textarea>
        <button onclick="showAnswer(1)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1" style="display: none;">
        <p>If your issue is not patient focused (if it is, then you have a computerized reporting system for that) every work environment has a chain of command typically it starts with the following and is escalated as required:<br>
        Charge nurse<br>
        Clinical Manager<br>
        Manager<br>
        Director<br>
        Vice President<br>
        President/CEO<br>
        If you are in a union, you can bring in your union representative at any point of the process of reporting your complaint.</p>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <div class="question" id="question2" style="display: none;">
        <p>How can you effectively communicate your needs and the needs of your coworkers to your organization?</p>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your answer here..."></textarea>
        <button onclick="showAnswer(2)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2" style="display: none;">
        <p>Start with the chain of command. Gather data to support your initiative, write it up in point form. Use a communication strategy to get your points across. (e.g., SBAR or STICC)<br>
        The STICC protocol has been adopted in several industries for providing structure to briefings and ensuring critical information has been understood.<br>
        Situation – Explain the situation and the problem<br>
        Task – Explain the recommended course of action<br>
        Intent – Explain why that action should be taken<br>
        Concern – Explain any issues that may arise and what to look out for<br>
        Calibrate – Invite the person to say if they do not understand. Ask if there is any reason why an action cannot be taken and for the receiver to express any concerns.</p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <div class="question" id="question3" style="display: none;">
        <p>Advocacy for organizational changes can take time and emotional investment. Why is it important to do?</p>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your answer here..."></textarea>
        <button onclick="showAnswer(3)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3" style="display: none;">
        <p>The consequences of not advocating for changes that impact you, your peers, and your patients are varied. Patient outcomes and patient safety may be negatively impacted in an organization where nurses are burned out. Organizational changes may help address nurse turnover and burnout. You spend a lot of time at work and there is a great sense of satisfaction if you feel listened to and contribute to meaningful improvements at your workplace.</p>
