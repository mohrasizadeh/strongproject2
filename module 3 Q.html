        <p>List some examples of symptoms related to mental health issues that you might see in nurses.</p>

        <p>There are many symptoms that may suggest a person is having mental health issues. Some to keep in mind are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Behavior changes: increases, decreases or changes in the quality of sleep, food, or substance use (prescription or non-prescription)</li>
            <li>Mood changes: increased sadness, anxiety, irritability, guilt, crying</li>
            <li>Cognitive changes: changes in self-esteem and impaired thinking (i.e., trouble concentrating, misremembering)</li>
            <li>Physical health changes: pain (stomach, head, back, chest), menstrual irregularities, headaches, dizziness, faintness, heart racing, shortness of breath, digestive problems, low energy/fatigue</li>
            <li>Feelings of distress</li>
            <li>Difficulty functioning with family, friends, work, hobbies</li>
            <li>Changes to hygiene or dress (decreased self-care)</li>
            <li>Job performance: double-checking simple known things, constantly seeking reassurance, changes in demeanor with patients, consistently arriving late or unprepared for shifts</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <div class="question" id="question2" style="display: none;">
        <p>What might you see in someone experiencing severe mental health symptoms?</p>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your answer here..."></textarea>
        <button onclick="showAnswer(2)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer2" style="display: none;">
        <p>There may be an increase in the intensity and number of the above listed symptoms. Symptoms are likely to be present most of the day and almost every day for weeks or months. These issues are also likely to impact functioning in multiple areas, not just work performance.</p>
        <button onclick="showQuestion(3)">Next</button>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <div class="question" id="question3" style="display: none;">
        <p>Nurses are often exposed to severe cases of mental unwellness requiring hospitalization. They may therefore downplay or dismiss their own symptoms of mental health disturbances. What can you say to highlight the importance of addressing mental health concerns?</p>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your answer here..."></textarea>
        <button onclick="showAnswer(3)">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3" style="display: none;">
        <p>Unfortunately, because of the stigma associated with mental health disturbances, many people will try to hide or downplay the severity or impact of their symptoms. Assessment by a trained mental health professional or healthcare provider can provide clarity and an opportunity to discuss next steps. Like all health concerns, early identification and intervention are key to reducing harm/consequences. Mental health symptoms should be addressed before patient safety concerns arise.</p>
